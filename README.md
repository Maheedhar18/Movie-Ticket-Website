## Xp Core Values Followed:
#### Communication:
###### We communicated by meeting atleast 3 times a week and never miss a meeting to ensure we work together as a team. We all followed the same strategy for coding so that the code is understood by everyone.
#### Simplicity:
##### We wrote simple code bringing more value to a product, as it saves time and effort. We worked on writing a simple code initially and improving upon it to make it more refined.
